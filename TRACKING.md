# Yongqiang Tian paper tracker

Last public-source sweep: **2026-09-01**.

This file separates the discovery queue from completed reproduction directories. It intentionally includes preprints and tool demonstrations that may not yet be prominent in Scholar/DBLP so they do not get lost between daily runs.

## Discovery note (2026-09-01)

A fresh public-source sweep did not surface a newer 2026 Yongqiang Tian compiler/testing/program-reduction paper beyond the already tracked July preprints and current publication-page entries. Following the priority rule, today's study moved backward to **Latra (ASE 2025)**, which has an official public artifact and directly informs DRReduce/PROJ/LPR+ style reduction work.

The public Latra artifact reproduces the headline per-case token improvements (33.77% C, 9.17% SMT-LIB) and the paper-style SMT token means, but its post-publication Latra query/time CSV columns differ materially from Figure 4. The study records that snapshot drift instead of treating current artifact outputs as identical to the paper-era experiment.

## Next queue

Re-scan 2026 first. If no new item appears, next priority is **Boosting Program Reduction with the Missing Piece of Syntax-Guided Transformations** (OOPSLA 2025), then weighted/probabilistic delta debugging work.
