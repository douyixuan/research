# Yongqiang Tian paper tracker

Last public-source sweep: **2026-08-25**.

This file separates the discovery queue from completed reproduction directories. It intentionally includes preprints and tool demonstrations that may not yet be prominent in Scholar/DBLP so they do not get lost between daily runs.

## Discovery note (2026-08-25)

The refreshed author publication page exposed three 2026 SPLASH/ISSTA tool demonstrations that the tracker had missed: **RepoTrace**, **DebugTracker**, and **LPR+**. CrossLangFuzzer is also now explicitly listed as a tool demonstration in addition to its arXiv preprint. LPR+ was selected immediately because it is both new 2026 work and directly relevant to LLM-aided program reduction.

No newer compiler/testing/program-reduction preprint dated after the already tracked July work was found in today's public-source sweep.

## Next queue

1. **Unmasking the Type Inference Capabilities of LLMs for Java Code Snippets** — 2026 TOSEM and compiler/code-reasoning adjacent; natural follow-up to Scitix.
2. **RepoTrace** — new 2026 tool demo; useful for evidence provenance in GitHub-based empirical research.
3. **DebugTracker** — new 2026 tool demo; process-evidence tooling.
4. **TEMPLATEFUZZ** — 2026 testing work, but lower priority for the compiler-focused track.
5. **Enhancing Differential Testing with LLMs for Testing Deep Learning Libraries** — DBLP publication-year drift remains recorded; reproduce after higher-priority 2026 queue.
